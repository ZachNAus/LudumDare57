  allLogs:
  - What first appears to be a mass of floating water is in fact a Worble! Its a
    mass of... well, floating water. Given that its both alive and seemingly very
    friendly, I probably wouldn't try to drink it.
  - As you might expect from looking at it, Worble is capable of using water to attack
    and defend. The water rings that orbit around it allow it to constantly cycle
    water out, keeping it fresh and healthy.
  - I previously mentioned how friendly Worble is, but its also very interested in
    trying to be as helpful as possible. Unfortunately, there's only so much a ball
    of water can really help with.
