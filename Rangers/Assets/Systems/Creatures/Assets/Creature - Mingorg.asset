  allLogs:
  - These creatures shed the crystals on their back in place for new ones, meaning
    if you find stray crystals around, there is one nearby.
  - When moving downhill, it seems like they enjoy curling into a spiky ball and
    rolling down. I've seen a couple with their crystal backs stuck to trees.
  - In order to keep up with the energy needed for growing so many crystals on their
    back, they seem to be constantly migrating for berries.
