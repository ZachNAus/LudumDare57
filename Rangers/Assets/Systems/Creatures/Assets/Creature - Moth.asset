  allLogs:
  - An alarmingly large moth creature, with a striking colour scheme. The inside
    of its wings are covered in markings that resemble the magic circles that Rune
    Rangers use, which might suggest an interesting adaptation over time?
  - Turns out those markings aren't just for show. Runesect has managed to learn
    some of the spells we use, making it a very dangerous foe. Fortunately, it doesn't
    seem capable of using the Capture spell. Can you imagine?
  - It is learning from me.
