  allLogs:
  - A very fluffy creature that falls somewhere between fox and dog. An Orbuncle
    is inseperable from its orb, which it uses levitation magic to carry around.
  - Orbuncle appears to be adept with arcane magic, likely empowered by its orb.
    Above its head rests large appendages that aren't quite ears, adorned with gems
    that seem to further increase its power. Perhaps they are some kind of antennae?
  - Orbuncle is an extremely docile creature, and a very low-maintenance companion.
    It is content to lay around, simply staring into its orb. Some suspect that Orbuncle
    is able to see into the future through its orb, but nobody has proven it yet.
