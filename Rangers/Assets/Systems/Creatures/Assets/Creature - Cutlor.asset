  allLogs:
  - An aquatic creature with a strange ring-like object around it. It seems to be
    extremely intelligent, possessing some amount of psychic power.
  - Cutlor is capable of moving both itself and other objects using its mind. The
    ring around it amplifies these abilities greatly, allowing it to contend with
    even the strongest of creatures.
  - With great intelligence, you might think that Cutlor would be well-behaved, but
    it is actually incredibly fond of pranks. Nobody is sure exactly why, but it
    can be assumed that Cutlor finds great enjoyment in its harmless tricks.
